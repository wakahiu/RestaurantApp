# RestaurantApp

##brief description

In this application, we implement a restaurant check-in & check-out service for a group of two or more people. With this application on a smartphone, a group of customers can “check-in” anywhere, order food, pay, and rate. The use of Cloud Computing to store vital information, data, and pictures will allow for pleasant experience while the use of IPSec will provide essential protection and a peace of mind to the users of the application.
